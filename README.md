# GenMR

GenMR is an open-source Python package for research and development in catastrophe dynamics. It provides the probabilistic Generic Multi-Risk (GenMR) framework along with a digital template for multi-risk simulations in a fully parameterizable virtual environment. The catastrophe dynamics process is structured into three sequential steps:
1. Virtual environment generation - handled by `GenMR.environment.py` (*upcoming*)
2. Definition of stochastic events for individual perils - handled by `GenMR.perils.py` (*upcoming*)
3. Simulation of chains-of-events and risk drivers - handled by `GenMR.dynamics.py` (*planned for Fall 2026*).

Other modules are also planned:
- `GenMR.utils.py` - general-purpose utilities
- `GenMR.assess.py` - risk assessment tools

This work is being developed as part of the 2025â€“2027 project "A Generic Multi-Risk (GenMR) Open-Source Platform to Model Compound Catastrophes", funded by the <a href="https://foundation.scor.com/funded-projects/generic-multi-risk-genmr-open-source-platform-model-compound-catastrophes" target="_blank">SCOR Foundation for Science</a>.

The primary objective of this project is to advance our understanding of compound events through the development of the GenMR platform. By compound events, we refer to domino effects, cascading processes, and other amplification mechanisms that can escalate into super-catastrophes. GenMR is designed to help users address fundamental research and risk management questions, such as:
- What are the dominant patterns of event chains that drive large losses?
- Which critical events or drivers contribute most to the buildup of systemic risk?
- How does the generic risk profile â€” measured through indicators such as annual average loss (AAL), exceedance probability (EP) curves, and related metrics â€” change under different model parameterizations?

The GenMR framework and digital template are designed to be generic by construction. To capture the fundamentals of multi-risk, they employ the simplest possible models, offering a parsimonious yet effective representation of complex Earth system dynamics. At the same time, GenMR aims to be comprehensive in scope, enabling the exploration of potential interactions both within and across natural, technological, and socio-economic systems.
