    "# Tutorial 1: Generating a virtual environment for the GenMR digital template\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The _digital template_, first described in [Mignan (2022b)](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/23/16097) and used in the CAT Risk Modelling Sandbox [Mignan (2024)](https://github.com/amignan/Intro2CATriskModelling/blob/main/CATRiskModellingSandbox_tutorial.ipynb), is a microcosm simulation of the complex Earth system for catastrophe dynamics R&D, multi-risk prototyping in the Generic Multi-Risk (GenMR) framework, and catastrophe risk eduction. It is defined as a virtual environment populated by loss-generating events that interact with each other and with the environment. The virtual environment, to be built in this tutorial, is composed of _environmental layers_ that consist of sets of variables $\\theta(x,y)$ defined in a spatial grid of coordinates $(x,y)$. Each layer may be altered by _environmental objects_ located within the layer. The parsimonious complex Earth system finally consists of a stack of interacting environmental layers defined in the natural, technological and socio-economic systems. The loss-generating events that populate the virtual environment will be defined in the next tutorial, and their occurrence rates and interactions in a third and final tutorial.\n",
